# social-hub

This project wants to bring the largest social networking platforms in one place to enable creators to share their touchts an ideas easier. The big take away will be the integration with GitHub(push, pull actions) that will make the life of developers easier by sharing the changes or the big version changes using a predefined template .

API = 8000
WEB = 8080

Note: Until I get good at React I am afraid that all development will be done in tha api folder this way i when i will make the change to React
The only folder that will remain here will be the one that hold the api routes

Road map:

1. The beginning(Basic set up for the app,just the API folder until i will can work on the React app)
2. Design the user model for the Data Base
3. Create the auth routes with the Passport Js library(GitHub Auth only?)
4. Implement the GitHub Api.
